/**
 * @brief A torch-spyre internal container for executing a unit of work
 *
 * A JobPlan bundles everything needed to execute a unit of work on a stream.
 * It is produced by translating a SpyreCode's Job Execution Plan after the Job
 * Preparation Plan has been executed. flex never sees a JobPlan — SpyreStream
 * extracts the operations and submits them to RuntimeStream.launchOperation()
 * as a vector<RuntimeOperation>.
 *
 * A JobPlan is self-contained: if a compute requires program correction, the
 * correction callback, the correction tensor DMA, and the device compute are
 * all separate steps in the same JobPlan. For pure data movement (e.g., tensor
 * .to(device) or binary loading), a JobPlan with only DMA steps is used.
 *
 * Producers:
 * - Backend compiler (deeptools) via torch-spyre: Deeptools produces a
 *   SpyreCode JSON per SDSC. torch-spyre translates the SpyreCode into a
 *   JobPlan — executing the Job Preparation Plan (allocations, binary loading)
 *   and translating the Job Execution Plan into JobPlanStep entries with
 *   resolved CompositeAddress values. A single torch.compile call may produce
 *   multiple SDSCs, resulting in multiple JobPlans.
 * - Communications libraries: Create JobPlans for inter-device data transfers,
 *   collective operations, or other multi-step communication patterns.
 * - torch-spyre: Assembles JobPlans for tensor .to(device) moves (single
 *   RuntimeOperationH2D step), tensor .to("cpu") readbacks (single
 *   RuntimeOperationD2H step), or any other sequence of operations it needs to
 *   containerize.
