"""Op-specific work-division constraints, collected in one place.

work_division.py's core algorithm (span reduction, priority-based
distribution, the matmul cost model) is generic over the iteration space. A
few ops/layouts additionally forbid splitting specific dims, or force a dim's
split to an exact value, for reasons the generic algorithm has no way to know
about — e.g. the backend cannot coordinate-mask a dim spread over cores, or a
QFP8WT tensor's second stick dimension must stay whole.
``collect_work_division_constraints`` calls each rule and merges the results,
so work_division.py's call sites only need one call instead of hand-invoking
every rule.

def coarse_tile_local_dim_split_domains(
    ctx: WorkDivConstraintContext,
) -> ConstraintResult:
    """Pin every coarse-tile-local dim's work-division split to 1, on every op.

    ``allowed_splits`` values are core-partition *counts* (legal divisors of
    a dim's extent), not the extent itself -- ``multi_dim_iteration_space_split``
    (work_division.py) initializes every dim's split to 1 by default, meaning
    "one partition covers the dim's full extent, walked serially inside the
    op's own loop" (see ``TensorWorkDivision.work_slices``'s docstring in
    ``op_spec.py``). A coarse-tile-local dim's extent is already the correct
    per-tile size decided by coarse_tile.py's own loop nest; work_division
    must never fragment it further across cores, or two ops in the same
    fused loop body could disagree about which core owns which slice of that
    dim (``committed_splits``/ownership is keyed by split count, so a split
    other than the deliberate, uniform value of 1 breaks that agreement).
    ``work_distribution``/``span_reduction`` divide each op in the graph
    independently, so without this pin an op's own greedy, size-priority core
    search (``_default_split`` -> ``multi_dim_iteration_space_split``) could
    otherwise choose a split > 1 for a dim that must stay whole -- confirmed
    by a minimal B+H coarse-tiled matmul repro producing stale cross-tile
    data when that happened.

    Skips generated scratch-copy ops entirely (see
    ``_GENERATED_COPY_OP_PREFIXES``): a copy op's own tile-local dims are not
    shared, cross-op, ownership the way a self-planning op's loop variable
    is, and pinning them can defeat the per-core span-limit search on a copy
    whose read spans the full, un-tiled source tensor.

    ``coarse_tile.py`` stamps ``op.loop_info`` (a ``CoarseTileInfo``) on every
    op it tiles. ``loop_tiled_dims``/``loop_tiled_reduction_dims`` name tiled
    dims by *raw position into ``op.data.ranges``/``reduction_ranges``*.
    Historically this raw numbering was only self-consistent for an op that
    planned its own tiling: a generated read-copy op
    (``_insert_all_read_copy_ops``, coarse_tile.py) used to inherit
    ``loop_tiled_dims``/``loop_tiled_reduction_dims`` verbatim from the
    *sizing op* it copies for, still numbered in the sizing op's ranges,
    which can disagree with the copy's own ``data.ranges``
    position-for-position (issue: a minimal B+H coarse-tiled matmul repro
    produced ``Unsupported: Cannot satisfy mandatory split 64 for d1 within
    32 cores``, tracing to exactly this: the copy's own D axis at position 1
    misread as the sizing op's H axis). ``coarse_tile.py`` now recomputes
    ``loop_tiled_dims``/``loop_tiled_reduction_dims`` for a generated copy in
    the copy's own raw-position space too (from the same ``read_level_extents``
    data used for ``tiled_dims_per_read``), so ``loop_tiled_dims`` is now sound
    to read directly for every op, self-planning or copy.

    ``loop_tiled_dims`` must be the primary source (not
    ``tiled_dims_per_read``/``output_tiled_dims``): for a self-planning op
    whose only read is of a generated copy buffer,
    ``tiled_dims_per_read``'s entry for that read is *deliberately* zeroed
    by ``_insert_all_read_copy_ops`` (the copy is per-tile scratch reused in
    place every iteration and "must not advance" -- the same
    ``_fixed_level_extents`` convention used for a copy's own
    ``output_tiled_dims``). That zeroing is correct for its own purpose
    (building the copy-read's ``device_tile_advance_expr``) but leaves
    ``tiled_dims_per_read``/``output_tiled_dims`` carrying no "is this op's
    own dim tiled" signal at all for such an op -- confirmed by a direct
    trace: ``buf0`` (reads only a generated copy) showed
    ``tiled_dims_per_read=[[[], []]]``, ``output_tiled_dims=[]``, so this
    constraint pinned nothing for ``buf0``'s own H/B dims, leaving them
    exposed to the greedy search's independent, unpinned choice.
    ``loop_tiled_dims`` has no such caveat: it is recomputed fresh from
    ``ctx.op``'s own ranges at whichever point (self-planning or copy
    construction) last stamped ``loop_info``, so it always reflects the
    current op's own tiling.

    Each raw position is translated to an ``ctx.it_space`` symbol via
    ``ctx.op``'s own raw->squeezed table (mirroring
    ``_raw_to_squeezed_pos``'s convention -- squeezed index ``i`` names
    symbol ``d{i}``), the same bridge ``_tiled_dims_for_dep`` itself uses,
    rather than an independent survivor-count walk that silently assumes
    the raw numbering already matches ``ctx.op.data.ranges`` (that
    assumption is what this function's docstring above documents as
    trustworthy now, but the translation step itself must still go through
    the table rather than being conflated with squeezed indices directly).

    The symbol built from ``d{i}`` MUST use ``sympy_index_symbol`` (the same
    constructor ``coarse_tile.py`` uses everywhere it builds a ``d{i}``
    iteration symbol, e.g. its ``sizing_symbol``/``symbol`` locals), not a
    plain ``sympy.Symbol`` -- ``sympy_index_symbol`` stamps extra assumptions
    (``integer=True`` etc.) that make its symbols compare unequal to a
    plain ``Symbol`` of the same name despite printing identically. Every
    key in ``ctx.it_space`` is a ``sympy_index_symbol``, so a plain
    ``Symbol(f"d{squeezed}")`` here silently fails every ``sym not in
    ctx.it_space`` check and ``pin()`` never sets anything -- confirmed by
    direct trace: for ``buf0``, ``sym`` printed as ``d0`` and
    ``ctx.it_space`` printed as ``{d0: 2, ...}``, yet ``sym not in
    ctx.it_space`` was ``True``. This was the actual reason this
    constraint never forced any split, for any op, since it was written --
    the coordinate-space/copy-op issues above are real but were never the
    thing silently defeating this function; a mismatched ``Symbol``
    constructor was.

    ``loop_tiled_reduction_dims`` can be non-empty on an op whose own
    ``data`` is a ``Pointwise`` with no ``reduction_ranges`` at all: a
    reduction combine op (``_insert_combine_op``, coarse_tile.py)
    deliberately inherits ``loop_tiled_reduction_dims`` verbatim from the
    ``Reduction`` op it combines into, purely so the scheduler places it in
    the same ``CountedLoopSchedulerNode`` -- the reduction dim has already
    been reduced away and does not exist in the combine op's own iteration
    space, so there is nothing of that dim left to pin here. Guard on
    ``ctx.op.data`` actually exposing ``reduction_ranges`` before indexing
    into it, rather than assuming a non-empty ``loop_tiled_reduction_dims``
    implies one exists.
