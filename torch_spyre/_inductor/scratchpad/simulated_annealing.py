# Implement the algorithm from this paper:
#
# Imanishi, Akifumi, and Zijian Xu. "A heuristic for periodic memory allocation
# with little fragmentation to train neural networks." In Proceedings of the 2024
# ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management, pp. 82-94. 2024.
#
# The paper describes a few algorithms that work together to come up with a good
# allocation scheme. The problem setting differs slightly from ours in that they
# have a fixed set of buffers that are all to be allocated, and they want to do it
# in as little space as possible. By contrast, in our case, we have a fixed amount
# of space and we want to allocate those buffers that will give the best
# performance -- which we can probably approximate by saying, we want to minimize
# the volume of HBM transfers.
#
# Algorithm 4 is the simulated annealing algorithm that comes up with the
# permutation. It takes as inputs an annealing schedule, a list of buffers, and an
# initial permutation. One iteration randomly selects a buffer, and then cleverly
# compares all possible positions where the buffer could be reinserted. In effect,
# it cheaply considers (n-1) neighbours every iteration.
#
# In order to adjust this algorithm to our setting, we hold a
# PermutationBasedLayoutSolver from plan_solver as a member. It lets us use a
# permutation of buffers as a source of a layout plan, and modify the permutation
# and see the modification in the layout plan by repeated swapping. Each
# reinsertion sweep runs on a throwaway plan.copy(), so the live plan only performs
# the rotation that is actually accepted rather than sweeping and restoring. We
# also adjust our random sampling: a buffer that is currently allocated legally
# gets to consider being inserted into all other positions, whereas a buffer that
# is not currently allocated legally only gets to consider being reinserted in
# positions of (nearly) legally allocated buffers, so that we don't spend too much
# time on swaps that have no effect.
